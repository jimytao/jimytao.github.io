# 1.introduction:the symptom, not the joke

Over the past few months, I developed a habit that quietly got out of control: saving all kinds of things. Videos, manga, animaitons, novels--almost anything I found interesting--were stored away, rarely finished.

I began to behave like a colleting machine, trying to gather every possible source from the internet. However, after that, I had neither time nor energy to watch all the videos--or consume anything else--that I collected. All these things simply piled up in my space.

A person without digital hoarding also take notes and saves information. They may sometimes feel overlaoded,but they still have the ability to integrate what they collect and discard the essentail noise.

The conclusion is clear: The problem with digital hoarding is not storing information, but failing to convert it into action or understanding

# 3.Why the “Hamster” Metaphor Fits So Well

A hamster is a small, furry, short-tailed rodent known for its large cheek pouches which is used to carry food. Instinctively, hamsters hoard food in their cheek pouches and store it in preparation for times of scarcity, such as winter. This is a survival strategy shaped by evolution.

This is why the hamster works so well as a metaphor for dogotal hoarding. People hoard information unconsciously, not driven by immediate need, but by anxiety: the fear of missing out on knowledge and the fear of facing an uncertain future unprepared.
